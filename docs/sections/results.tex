A dashboard was developed with the aim to easily allow users to interact with model inference through a webserver. In figure 

% accuracy with respect to different ResNets used. The bigger the ResNet, the better the results should be

% Some accuracies wrt. hyperparameters tuning

% Some plots on losses
