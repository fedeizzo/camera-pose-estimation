\subsection{Dashboard}
A dashboard was developed with the aim to easily allow users to interact with model inference through a webserver. In \cref{fig:dashboard} is presented the \textit{UI} where red zones are not walkable areas.

% accuracy with respect to different ResNets used. The bigger the ResNet, the better the results should be

% Some accuracies wrt. hyperparameters tuning

% Some plots on losses
