\section{Conclusion}
Final results obtained are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item exploration of multiple labeled data generation techinques;
    \item COLMAP Povo 1 second floor reconstruction;
    \item creation of relative and absolute pose estimation models;
    \item fine-tuning of absolute pose estimation models;
    \item system deploy using a FastAPI webserver. 
\end{itemize}

Even if the proposed results are promising, there are still many approaches to inspect and to test.
Many of the future development of this work should concentrate on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item trying MapNet+, which is able to learn also from unlabeled data through a semi-supervised approach;
    \item trying MapNet+PGO, which performs pose graph optimization (PGO) during inference;
    \item testing the models in an outdoor environment, with different weather considerations;
    \item automatizing the coordinate reference system alignment procedure;
    \item build a more robust indoor dataset to validate the full potential of the proposed deep learning approach;
    \item deploy the model to the end-user device to ensure privacy and better model performance.
\end{itemize}
