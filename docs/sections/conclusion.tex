\section{Conclusions}
To summarize, the final results presented in this work are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the exploration of multiple dataset generation techniques;
    \item the COLMAP reconstruction of Povo 1 second floor;
    \item the development of relative and absolute pose estimation models;
    \item the fine-tuning of absolute pose estimation models;
    \item the post-processing of the model outputs;
    \item the model deployment using a FastAPI web-server. 
\end{itemize}

But, even if the proposed results are promising, there are still many things to consider.
Many of the future development of this work should concentrate on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item trying MapNet+, which is able to learn also from unlabeled data through a semi-supervised approach;
    \item trying MapNet+PGO, which performs pose graph optimization (PGO) during inference time;
    \item modifying the model loss to penalize predictions which are in a non-walkable area;
    \item testing the models in an outdoor environment, with different weather conditions;
    \item automatizing the coordinate reference system alignment procedure;
    \item build a more robust indoor dataset to validate the full potential of the proposed deep learning approach;
    \item deploy the model to the end-user device to ensure privacy and better model performance.
\end{itemize}
