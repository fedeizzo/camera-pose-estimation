\begin{abstract}
The task of camera pose estimation aims to find the position of the camera that captured an image within a given environment.
While different geometric approaches have already been studied in the literature, the aim of this project is to analyze and improve the performances of deep learning models for the camera pose estimation problem.
In this work, we analyze models for both relative camera pose estimation (MeNet) and absolute camera pose estimation (PoseNet, MapNet). Moreover, we propose a pipeline for the generation of a ground truth dataset based on structure from motion techniques (COLMAP).
Finally, we (1) show how the proposed framework has been used to build a dataset of the second floor of the Povo 1 building in the University of Trento, (2) train an absolute pose estimation model with PyTorch, and (3) deploy it through a web dashboard using FastAPI.
The deep learning approach could give interesting results in combination with geometric methods, especially for: relocation after lost tracking, closed-loop detection, better dealing with moving objects in the scene. Even if the SOTA deep learning approach for this field is less accurate than geometric ones, it ensures more generalization capabilities at a reduced  computational cost.
